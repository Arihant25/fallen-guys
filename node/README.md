## Overview

This project implements an advanced machine learning-based fall detection system using sensor acceleration data. The system continuously monitors and analyzes acceleration measurements to identify potential fall events in real-time.

### Key Features
- Multi-model machine learning approach
- Dynamic threshold optimization
- Handling of class-imbalanced datasets
- Real-time data processing
- Automatic model retraining and threshold adjustment

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Data Acquisition**: ThingSpeak IoT platform
2. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Decision Tree Classifier
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
   - Random Undersampling
   - Feature Scaling

## Technical Details

### Machine Learning Approach

#### Model Selection
The system uses three different machine learning algorithms to detect falls:

1. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble learning method
   - Creates multiple decision trees
   - Provides robust classification
   - Handles non-linear relationships
   - Reduces overfitting through ensemble voting

2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Finds optimal hyperplane separating classes
   - Uses Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel
   - Effective in high-dimensional spaces
   - Handles complex decision boundaries

3. **Decision Tree**
   - Creates tree-like decision model
   - Simple and interpretable
   - Captures non-linear relationships
   - Prone to overfitting (mitigated by ensemble methods)

#### Class Imbalance Handling
Fall detection datasets are typically imbalanced, with few fall events compared to normal activities.

Techniques used:
- **SMOTE**: Generates synthetic minority class samples
- **Random Undersampling**: Reduces majority class samples
- **Class Weighting**: Adjusts model sensitivity to minority class

### Performance Metrics

The system evaluates models using:
- **Precision**: Proportion of true fall detections
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual falls correctly identified
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Threshold Optimization
- Dynamically determines optimal classification threshold
- Translates probability threshold to acceleration value
- Minimizes false positives and false negatives

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - Fetch acceleration data from ThingSpeak
   - Extract fall labels and acceleration values

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Apply SMOTE and undersampling
   - Standardize features using StandardScaler
   - Split data into training and testing sets

3. **Model Training**
   - Train multiple models
   - Optimize probability thresholds
   - Select best-performing model

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Periodically retrain models
   - Update fall detection threshold
   - Real-time fall event detection
